# X-Wing_trainer.bas

My QBasic programm from 12th Oktober 1994. It's to modify the pilot file from the computer game X-Wing. It supports also supports the mission packs "Imperial Pursuit" and "B-Wing".
You can edt whitch missions you have completed or which awards you have won.
In the past some cheating tools are called "trainer". So I used this description for the programm.

It runs under MS-DOS.
