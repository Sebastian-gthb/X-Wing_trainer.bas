# X-Wing_trainer.bas

My QBasic programm from 12th Oktober 1994. It's to modify the pilot file from the computer game X-Wing. It also supports the mission packs "Imperial Pursuit" and "B-Wing".
You can edit whitch missions you have completed or which awards you have won.
In the past some cheating tools are called "trainer". So I used this for naming the programm.

It runs under MS-DOS.

At the start you must enter an existing name of a pilot file. The pilot file must exist in the "current" directory. If you enter a non existing name it will create a new one. I'm not sure if a newly created file will work with the game.
